# Horizeon Refractor

## Description 

This project was so that I could take what was learned from the last few days of class and implement different techniques in shortening and making the css file easier to read. 

## Beginning Steps
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

Then navigate to the project directory
cd your-repo

Open the index.html file in a web browser or text editor.


## Learning Points 

I learned how many class's and ID's are interchangable unless specifically changed. When adding details to a specific part in the style.css. I realized that the "class" is like a family whereas the ID is the specific member in the familiy. 

HTML Structure: Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document

Metadata: How to specify character encoding and link an external CSS stylesheet 

Semantic HTML: The use of semantic HTML elements to structure and format content for readability and search engine optimization. 

Navigation: Creating a navigation menu using an unordered list with list items and hyperlinks

Images: Embedding images within content and using CSS classes (e.g., class="float-left") to control their placement and styling.

Sections and IDs: Defining sections with meaningful IDs (e.g., id="online-reputation-management") to enable linking to specific sections within the webpage.

Footer: Creating a footer with copyright information and attributing the website's creation.
